#Create Your Destiny (Team)

>A supplementary tool to the collectible card and dice game, Star Wars: Destiny.

###A little bit about Destiny

In order to play Star Wars: Destiny, you must first build a deck of 30 cards, 1 battlefield, and up to '30 points' of characters from the same side (heroes or villains).

Each character has an associated cost for playing that character with one die, or if applicable, two dice. For example, Maz Kanata costs 8 points to play with one die, and 11 to play with two.

Generally, more powerful characters cost more points to play, so players will want to maximize their use of 30 points for the most powerful team. A team that adds up to 26 is not optimal, but a team of 28 to 30 is ideal.

###How this interfaces with Destiny

Create Your Destiny (Team) is a responsive and mobile-friendly JavaScript web application built to aid users in choosing a team for their deck.

Users can:
  * Add characters to their team
  * Filter characters by color
  * See the remaining point total dynamically update

##Installation

Clone this repository and open index.html with your favorite browser.

##Next Steps

My goal for this application is to help users not only find legal character combinations (within the 30 point limit), but to also find combinations that maximize other attributes, leading the user to both creative and powerful character combos.

Additional data could include:
- [ ] Adding die sides (melee, range, shield, disrupt, discard, special, blank)
- [ ] Adding set (publish date)

Additional filters could include:
- [ ] by health
- [ ] by die side
- [ ] by set

Furthermore, the data here is incomplete. I could finish the data myself, or explore the [swdestinydb.com API](https://swdestinydb.com/api/).
